# SopraCovoit Android App.

This application has been creating to answer a project seen in the 4th year of INSA Toulouse. 
The Company SOPRA came to us, and asked each group to develop and design a carpooling application, 
allowing them to contact each others to share rides between their workplace and their homes.

This is the applciation we designed to answer it. It lets user register, and see rides that goes towards/from the workplace.


There is two side projects to this one, a [server](https://github.com/SopraCovoit/SiteWeb) developped using JavaEE, 
and an [admin page](https://github.com/SopraCovoit/SiteWeb) developped using AngularJS.

The application targets API14+, with simple optimisation for Lollipop (styles, ripples,...). It is supposed to respect the 
Material Design guidelines as much as we could, in the short timeframe we had.

You can either import the application in your ide, or download the apk given as a release.
